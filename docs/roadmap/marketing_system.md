# QualiaIA – Marketing System

The **Marketing System** is QualiaIA's "voice and growth engine".

It runs the campaigns for all QualiaIA ventures:

- For each venture, there is at least a **Community Manager** and a **Marketing Director**
- At the QualiaIA level, there are **marketing executives** who respond to and execute on QualiaIA's strategic decisions

The system uses research, venture data, and performance metrics to craft and iterate on how QualiaIA and its ventures are presented to humans. From a **production** point of view, it defines how growth, communication, and campaign operations must run once QualiaIA is live.
